For my multipage website, I focused on creating a visually appealing and responsive layout. The dark background color (rgb(59, 12, 12)) was to provide a sleek, modern aesthetic, while the accent color (#ff6f61) adds vibrancy to buttons and hover states, making them stand out. I used a simple, intuitive structure with a navigation bar at the top and key sections (Home, About, and Contact) below, ensuring easy access to all parts of the site.

In terms of JavaScript functionality, I implemented:
- **Dynamic Page Switching**: The showPage() function enables seamless transitions between sections, hiding and displaying content based on user interaction.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: The scrollToSection() function allows users to smoothly scroll to specific sections of the page.
- **Image Slider**: An interactive slider in the "About" section, where users can navigate through images using the changeSlide() function.
- **Image Gallery Modal**: A modal window opens when the user clicks the gallery link, displaying images in a popup, with a close function to exit.

One challenge was ensuring the website was fully responsive across different devices. I overcame this by using flexbox, media queries, and optimizing images.

I deployed the website on **GitHub Pages** by pushing the project files to a GitHub repository and enabling GitHub Pages in the repository settings for live hosting.
